# studdy

Studdy is a mobile application designed to address the lack of easily accessible and tailored study materials for the Kenyan new Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) education system, particularly at the high school level. This project utilizes Docker containers for development and deployment and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The app is developed using Flutter for the frontend and Java for backend services.

Studdy aims to solve this problem by providing a user-friendly platform that offers a comprehensive collection of study materials, catering to the specific requirements of the CBC curriculum.
